# SAMPA: Music Producer Contact Organizer

SAMPA is a tool designed to help music producers and artists organize their contacts by genre and other metrics. This allows for easier filtering and targeted emailing of new songs to potential industry connections. This project is tailored to specific needs of a group of music producers and not intended for general use.

## Installation

The project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

- pandas
- openpyxl
- sqlalchemy
- pydantic
- smtplib

You can install all the required dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

The code provided is only for potential hiring companies to see my quality of code and understand how I use those technologies.

## Email Sending

The tool provides the capability of send emails to the selected contacts using the SMTP library and using the data from the excel sheet to fill the recipient and subject of the email. However it's not intended for use and is presented here as a demonstration of my skills.
